[INIT] Created checklist + progress log. Next: complete exactly ONE FAILING item, validate it, then update this log.

[2026-02-11 Session 1] Created CLAUDE.md
- Created: CLAUDE.md (standard format with required header)
- Removed: CLAUDE.custom.md (content integrated into CLAUDE.md)
- CLAUDE.md includes:
  - Setup commands (venv activation, running modelling)
  - Repository structure and file map
  - Architecture principles (5 absolute rules)
  - Modelling deliverables (A-F requirements)
  - Development workflow (explore→plan→execute→verify loop)
  - RAG/retrieval guidance, budget safety, validation criteria
- Next: Begin modelling phase deliverables per CLAUDE.md checklist

[2026-02-11 Session 2] Completed item A: source_registry.yaml ✓
- Created: artifacts/modelling/source_registry.yaml (56 sources)
- Created: artifacts/modelling/MODELLING_CHECKLIST.md (tracking deliverables A-I)
- Source registry includes:
  - 20 Tier 1 sources (central banks, government stats, SEC filings)
  - 28 Tier 2 sources (reputable news, institutional letters, corporate IR)
  - 5 Tier 3 sources (supplementary/alternative perspectives)
  - 3 Tier 4 sources (monitor-only/low-trust for minority views)
- New source categories added:
  - Institutional letters: Oaktree (Howard Marks), GMO, Bridgewater, AQR, BlackRock, JPM AM
  - SEC filings: EDGAR latest, 8-K, 10-Q, 10-K, structured disclosure directory
  - Corporate IR: NVIDIA RSS (example), Apple/MSFT/TSLA placeholders for watchlist filtering
  - Asia coverage: RBA, RBI, HKMA, ADB (in addition to existing BoJ, PBoC, MAS)
- Paywall policy enforced: FT, WSJ, Bloomberg, Economist, Nikkei, Straits Times = metadata_only
- Tier 4 (monitor-only): ZeroHedge, Seeking Alpha, Ray Dalio LinkedIn
- All sources have: id, name, url, type (rss|html|pdf), tags, credibility_tier (1-4), fetch_interval, paywall_policy, notes
- Tags include: policy_centralbank, macro_data, macro_research, institutional_letter, institutional_pr, corporate_filings, earnings_ir, market_narrative, asia
- Validation: 56 sources, all required fields present, tier 1-4 system implemented
- Next recommended: Item B (data_model.md) — SQLite schema + FTS indexing plan

[2026-02-11 Session 3] Completed item D: citation_contract.md ✓
- Created: artifacts/modelling/citation_contract.md (442 lines)
- Defines citation object format (id, source_id, url, title, published_at, chunk_id, quote_span)
- Bullet-level rule: every bullet in Prevailing/Counter/Minority/Watch requires ≥1 citation
- Validator behavior: missing citations → remove claim or mark "insufficient evidence"
- Evidence-pack: max 30 chunks, diversity constraints (publisher <40%, tier-1/2 ≥50%), credibility weighting
- Paywall rule: metadata-only citations for paywalled sources, no fabricated full text
- Abstain language: explicit "insufficient evidence" markers when data unavailable
- Includes: storage schema, example valid/invalid outputs, citation presentation format
- Next recommended: Item B (data_model.md) or C (pipeline.md)

[2026-02-11 Session 4] Refined item D: citation_contract.md (remains PASSING)
- Refined: artifacts/modelling/citation_contract.md (558 lines, was 442)
- Added Claude API structured citations compatibility section (§2): API citations map to our schema, presentation vs storage layer
- Split paywall spans: quote_span (full-text only) vs snippet_span (RSS/headline, allowed for metadata_only sources)
- Added citation quality checks (§3.1): numeric/time claims require Tier 1-2 or 2+ independent sources; policy claims require Tier 1 when available
- Added publisher field to citation object (derived from sources table, used for diversity checks)
- Added retry policy (§3.2): ≤3 removals → deliver; >3 or empty section → retry once; 2nd failure → abstaining report
- Replaced SQL DDL with storage requirements list (full schema deferred to data_model.md)
- Cost safety: deterministic retry behavior prevents runaway synthesis attempts
- Next recommended: Item B (data_model.md) or C (pipeline.md)

[2026-02-12 Session 5] Updated spec & citation granularity (no checklist item completed)
- Updated: CLAUDE.md
  - Added greeting requirement: Claude must start with "Hello Jane,"
  - Reinforced budget/cost controls + session restart expectations
- Updated: PRD v1.1
  - Clarified MVP defaults + alert limits + ingestion caps + budget guard behavior
- Updated: citation_contract.md → v1.1
  - Changed from bullet-level to claim-level binding (sentence/span coverage)
  - Added formatting constraint: prefer 1 claim per bullet, max 2 sentences; split if sources differ
  - Updated validator guidance to parse claim spans
- Checklist impact: D remains PASSING; no new deliverable marked complete
- Next: Complete Item B (data_model.md) with SQLite schema + FTS plan (must align with v1.1 citation rules)
